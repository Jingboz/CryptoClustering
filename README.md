# CryptoClustering

This repository is for module 19 challenge - CryptoClustering. 

After importing the dataset from crypto_market_data.csv, we first scale and normalize the data for further analysis. With the knowledge of K-means, the original data was used to predict the clusters with the best value of k. And then, we used Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensions of data to three, and do the same process of finding the best k value as well as predict the clusters. The comparison of these two different method was concluded in the end.
